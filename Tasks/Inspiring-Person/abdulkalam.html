      <h2>Missile Man Of India üöÄ</h2>

      <p>
        Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam
        studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
        decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
        Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
        space programme and military missile development efforts. He was known
        as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of
        ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a
        pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II
        nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in
        1974. Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the
        support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
        then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as
        the "People's President". He engaged in teaching, writing and public
        service after his presidency. He was a recipient of several awards,
        including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

        On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament,
        accompanied by then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and senior
        cabinet members.[47] He faced off against Lakshmi Sahgal, and the
        polling for the presidential election was held on 15 July 2002, in the
        Indian parliament and the state assemblies, with the media predicting a
        win for Kalam.[48] The counting was held on 18 July, and Kalam won the
        elections after securing 922,884 electoral votes as against the 107,366
        votes won by Sahgal.[49] He was sworn in as the 11th president of India
        on 25 July 2002.[50][51] He was the first scientist and the first
        bachelor to occupy the top chair at Rashtrapati Bhawan.[52]
